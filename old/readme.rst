Welcome to ``stk-vis``!

Before you get started, you might like to watch the demo video

``stk-vis`` is a cross-platform viewer for molecules and molecular
properties, specifically targeting cases where you want to browse
through multiple molecules quickly. Its main strength is allowing
smoother collaboration between multiple people or between multiple
research groups, but it is also a useful tool for individual users.

So how does ``stk-vis`` do this? ``stk-vis`` connects to local
or remote MongoDB molecular databases, which hold the molecules you
would like to view, as well as their properties. If you think
using a MongoDB database is a bit of a chore, I promise you that
it is actually trivial, that you don't need to know anything about
databases, and I will show you how to build one!

Assuming that you have your database, or someone has provided one
for you, you can connect to it from anywhere. For example, try
downloading the `latest release`_ of
``stk-vis`` for your platform and using the following URL::

    mongodb+srv://stk-vis:example@stk-vis-example.x4bkl.mongodb.net

.. _`latest release`: https://github.com/lukasturcani/stk-vis/releases

Here is a picture of your connection settings:

.. figure:: example-connection.png

This should connect you to a public database I made. Note that you
don't have to change any of the other default values.
(The connection might be a bit slow because I'm using a free server
hosted in Europe, but when you use your own database it should be much
faster.) You can also make your databases private and only allow access
to specific users.

To give an example use case, you can have a group of computational
scientists depositing molecules and their properties into the database,
and their  synthetic collaborators can immediately see which molecules
have been added and what their properties are, in order to see if they
would like to make anything. The synthetic group does not need
to worry about databases at all, they just need to download ``stk-vis``
and connect to the URL the computational team provides them with.
Similarly, the computational team does not have worry too much about
databases either, as they can deposit molecules and their properties
into them with one very simple Python function.

In fact, any time you are dealing with lots of molecules, or lots
of molecular files, it is probably a good idea to switch to using a
database, whether you are working as an individual or not. This keeps
all your data easy to access and organized.

Features
========

* 3D interactive molecular rendering.
* 2D molecular projection.
* Tabulation of any molecular properties deposited into the database.
* If you have molecules that were constructed from building block
  molecules, you can see which building blocks were used to make that
  molecule, and then you can see if those building blocks had building
  blocks too! You can keep doing this until you run out of building
  blocks.
* Sort molecules according to property values to quickly find ones
  with the best or worst properties.
* Saving molecular structure files.
* Sometimes 2D projections are expensive to calculate. As a result,
  you can toggle the 2D viewer on or off. You can also toggle the 3D
  viewer, but I suggest you first check if the 2D viewer is the
  cause of performance problems.

Latest Release
==============

You can see the latest release for your platform by clicking on the
following link:

    https://github.com/lukasturcani/stk-vis/releases

If you would like to get updates when a new version of ``stk-vis``
is released, simply click on the ``watch`` button in the top right
corner of the GitHub page, and if you only care about new releases,
select ``Releases only`` from the dropdown menu.

Setting Up Molecular Databases
==============================

So how do you actually get a molecular database? Well, there's a
Python library called ``stk``, which lets you do just that. But not
only that, as ``stk`` lets you easily construct molecules such as
polymers, organic & metal-organic frameworks, organic and
metal-organic cages, metal complexes, rotaxanes and more!

The GitHub for ``stk`` is here

    https://github.com/lukasturcani/stk

and the documentation can be found here

    https://stk.readthedocs.io

``stk`` lets you deposit regular or constructed molecules
into MongoDB molecular databases. ``stk`` molecules can also be
converted to and from ``rdkit`` molecules, if that's
convenient for your use-case. ``stk`` also  provides evolutionary
algorithms (EAs) for molecular design. This means you can run the EA
and it will deposit the molecules it discovers into the database
for you, and you can use ``stk-vis`` to easily browse the results!

Assuming you have ``stk`` installed and MongoDB running locally,
building molecular databases  is easy

.. code-block:: python

    import stk
    import pymongo
    import rdkit.Chem.AllChem as rdkit

    client = pymongo.MongoClient()
    db = stk.MoleculeMongoDb(
        mongo_client=client,
        # All of the parameters below are optional!
        database='stk',
        molecule_collection='molecules',
        position_matrix_collection='building_block_position_matrices',
    )

    # Create some molecule. "BuildingBlock" is just stk's word for a
    # plain molecule.
    molecule1 = stk.BuildingBlock('CCCBr')

    # Place it into the database, this will make the molecule
    # immediately viewable in stk-vis.
    db.put(molecule1)

    # Make an stk molecule from an rdkit molecule and deposit it into
    # the database. Note that the rdkit molecule must have a
    # position matrix.

    def get_rdkit_molecule(smiles):
        molecule = rdkit.AddHs(rdkit.MolFromSmiles(smiles))
        rdkit.EmbedMolecule(molecule, rdkit.ETKDGv2())
        return molecule

    molecule2 = stk.BuildingBlock.init_from_rdkit_mol(
        molecule=get_rdkit_molecule('CNCNN'),
    )
    db.put(molecule2)


``stk`` provides detailed documentation for `stk.MoleculeMongoDb`_.

.. _`stk.MoleculeMongoDb`: https://stk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stk.databases.mongo_db.molecule.html

Let's say you also want to deposit molecular properties into the
database so that they are available in ``stk-vis``

.. code-block:: python

    num_atoms_db = stk.ValueMongoDb(client, 'Num Atoms')

    # Place a value associated with the molecule into the database,
    # this will make it immediately viewable in stk-vis.
    num_atoms_db.put(molecule1, molecule1.get_num_atoms())
    num_atoms_db.put(molecule2, molecule2.get_num_atoms())

    # Lets also calculate and store the energy of a molecule with
    # UFF.


    def uff_energy(molecule):
        rdkit_molecule = molecule.to_rdkit_mol()
        rdkit.SanitizeMol(rdkit_molecule)
        ff = rdkit.UFFGetMoleculeForceField(rdkit_molecule)
        return ff.CalcEnergy()


    energy_db = stk.ValueMongoDb(client, 'UFF Energy')
    energy_db.put(molecule1, uff_energy(molecule1))
    energy_db.put(molecule2, uff_energy(molecule2))


In general, you can deposit any ``number`` or ``string``, or
``tuple`` of them
into a ``stk.ValueMongoDb``. ``stk`` also has detailed documentation
for `stk.ValueMongoDb`_

.. _`stk.ValueMongoDb`: https://stk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stk.databases.mongo_db.value.html

Finally, let's take a look at depositing constructed molecules.
These are molecules ``stk`` can construct from ``BuildingBlock``
molecules. There are many different kinds of these molecules, so
check out the documentation of ``stk`` to get a full picture.
However, when it comes to depositing them into a MongoDB, the process
is always the same.

.. code-block:: python

    # Create a database for depositing constructed molecules.
    constructed_db = stk.ConstructedMoleculeMongoDb(
        mongo_client=client,
        # All of the parameters below are optional!
        database='stk',
        molecule_collection='molecules',
        constructed_molecule_collection='constructed_molecules',
        position_matrix_collection='position_matrices',
        building_block_position_matrix_collection='building_block_position_matrices',
    )

    # Create a constructed molecule, in this case a polymer.
    polymer = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
        topology_graph=stk.polymer.Linear(
            building_blocks=(
                stk.BuildingBlock('BrC=CBr', [stk.BromoFactory()]),
                stk.BuildingBlock('BrCNCBr', [stk.BromoFactory()]),
            ),
            repeating_unit='AB',
            num_repeating_units=2,
        ),
    )

    # Deposit into the database.
    constructed_db.put(polymer)

    # You can deposit values same as before.
    num_atoms_db.put(polymer, polymer.get_num_atoms())
    energy_db.put(polymer, uff_energy(polymer))

The reason ``stk.ConstructedMoleculeMongoDb`` is used here, is that
it will automatically deposit the building blocks of ``polymer`` into
the database as well. This means that in ``stk-vis``, we can explicitly
search for the building blocks of ``polymer``. As before, ``stk`` has
detailed documentation for `stk.ConstructedMoleculeMongoDb`_.

.. _`stk.ConstructedMoleculeMongoDb`: https://stk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stk.databases.mongo_db.constructed_molecule.html

To get ``stk`` you need to run::

    $ pip install stk
    $ conda install -c conda-forge rdkit

Finally, you need to decide how to host your databases. You can
`install MongoDB locally on your computer`_, or you can use
`Mongo Atlas`_ to put your database in the cloud. This part might be a
pain, but it shouldn't be too difficult either. Once this is
done, depositing molecules and molecular properties into the database
will be  super easy with ``stk``, and then you and your collaborators
can then examine them with ``stk-vis``!
